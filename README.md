# CreditManager
Smart UI

You can create borrower, add credit, repay credit and all this in one application without any identification or authorization, nice. My first one.  There is transaction even. There aren’t used stored procedures but parametrized queries for connection to DB because I didn’t know about stored procedures. You can write report about debtor to a file.
Used technologies: WF, ADO.Net, MS SQL Server.
Language: C#.
